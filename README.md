# Happiness-Project
This project takes into account the top 15 happiest countries in 2022 and finds correlations between happiness scores and 6 factors measured. 
Conclusions were able to find that the top two factors that contribute to Happiness are social support and freedom to make choices. 
For the visualzations python was used. Libraries Numpy, Pandas Seaborn and Matplotlib are required to view run code. 
I retrieved the data from the World Happiness Report for 2022.
